# Game-Rethinking-of-Interstellar

This simple text game tells the story of the film Interstellar by the genius director Christopher Nolan. 

You can choose two options for passing the game: 
   >>> Fast (1-3 minutes) - to get distracted and quickly plunge into the world of fantasy,
   >>> Complete (2-6 minutes) - to get used to the role of the main character and experience the whole range of emotions of discovery and travel.
   
You have to decide the fate of mankind, making difficult but necessary decisions. You have to go through three main stages that can 
change the main characters' lives. It included raising a child, decrypting mysterious messages, methods of robbing banks, including breaking doors, 
and much more!

Have a good game! 1... 2... 3... Start!
